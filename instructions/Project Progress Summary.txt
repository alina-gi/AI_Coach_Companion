🧩 AI Coach Companion — Project Progress Summary
🧠 Phase 1 — Core Logic & Architecture

Goal: Build the internal “brain” of your AI companion.

✅ Completed

Response Engine:
Handles user input → analyzes sentiment (via TextBlob & Vader) → decides tone and feedback type.
→ Acts as the logic center of your app.

Feedback Manager:
Saves user feedback (like/dislike) with detected mood and tone used → builds personal learning data.

Preference System:
Stores user preferences (e.g., tone type: blunt, kind, supportive).
→ The app adapts its communication style dynamically.

Data Storage:
All data (mood logs, feedback, preferences) persist in JSON files.
→ This simulates user history for now — will later move to a database in the web version.

🎯 Purpose:
To make the app self-aware of emotional tone, context, and user’s past reactions — not just reply blindly.

🖥️ Phase 2 — Interface & Interaction

Goal: Build the frontend layer to visualize interaction and data.

✅ Completed

Tkinter-based interface with chat-style UI.

Added Analytics button (for backend insights).

Responses appear interactively with scrollable chat area.

Feedback buttons (like/dislike) integrated.

⚙️ In Progress

Analytics Hub (mood trend dashboard) partially done.

Can visualize feedback, moods, tone, but needs polishing and visual placement improvements.

Layout optimization (like repositioning “Open Analytics” button to top right).

🎯 Purpose:
Create an interactive, emotional, data-driven chat companion — not just console-based responses.

🔜 Phase 3 — Integration Layer

Goal: Add intelligence + prepare for web migration.

Next Steps

Integrate OpenAI API:

Replace hardcoded responses with GPT-generated ones.

Still run your ResponseEngine logic before/after GPT to keep emotional analysis and user adaptation.

Enhance Analytics Hub:

Show charts for mood trends, tone usage, and feedback ratios.

Add export/report features.

Session History Panel:

Display past conversations by date/time.

Option to clear or review.

🌐 Phase 4 (Future) — Web System

Goal: Convert the app into a web-based companion.

Planned:

Flask or FastAPI backend

React or Streamlit frontend

Login/auth system

Cloud-based user data

OpenAI integration for response generation

Admin/insight dashboard (for you)
