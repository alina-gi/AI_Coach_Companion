🧠 AI Coach Companion — Full Project Documentation (Phase 1–3 Overview)
1. Project Overview

Name: AI Coach Companion
Type: Intelligent Emotion-Aware Chat Application
Platform: Desktop (Tkinter GUI) — later to be migrated to Web (Flask/React or Streamlit)
Purpose:
A personalized AI companion that interacts with users in different tones (blunt, kind, supportive), learns from feedback, and adapts its responses based on mood and emotional data.

2. Core Concept

The system acts as a self-learning emotional coach, designed to:

Communicate in user-preferred tones

Detect emotional sentiment from user messages

Track feedback to improve tone selection

Provide analytics and insights into user interaction patterns

Key Idea:
Unlike ordinary chatbots that only generate responses, AI Coach Companion evolves emotionally and analytically — it “learns” the user’s mood, preferences, and reactions over time.

3. System Architecture
A. Core Modules

Response Engine

Handles text input/output.

Detects mood and sentiment using:

TextBlob for polarity.

VaderSentiment for intensity scoring.

Chooses response tone (supportive / blunt / neutral).

Connects with feedback data to self-adjust.

Feedback Manager

Captures user reaction after each AI message.

Saves user_message, ai_response, feedback, mood, and tone into JSON.

Builds the dataset for personalization and trend analysis.

Preference System

Stores user’s selected tone preference.

Ensures every reply aligns with that preference.

Persists across sessions.

Data Management

JSON-based local database structure.

Folder: /data/user_data.json

Stores cumulative logs for feedback, preferences, and mood states.

B. Frontend (Tkinter Interface)

Main Chat Window

Scrollable text display area.

User input box.

Feedback buttons (👍 👎).

Adaptive color theme (dark mode aesthetic).

Analytics Hub

Open via button (“📊 Analytics”).

Shows:

Preference Summary (text-based insights).

Mood Trend Dashboard (visual charts via Matplotlib).

Allows developers (you) to analyze how the model is behaving.

4. Data Flow

User Input → Response Engine
→ Detect sentiment and tone.

Response Engine → Feedback Manager
→ Save interaction + emotional metadata.

User Feedback → Preference System
→ Adjust tone for next responses.

Analytics Hub
→ Summarize and visualize all data trends.

5. Technology Stack
Component	Tool / Library	Purpose
GUI	Tkinter	Desktop user interface
NLP	TextBlob, VaderSentiment	Mood and sentiment detection
Data	JSON	Local storage for logs and preferences
Visualization	Matplotlib	Trend and mood analysis
API Integration (Future)	OpenAI GPT	Dynamic and context-aware responses
Backend (Future)	Flask / FastAPI	Web-based deployment
Frontend (Future)	React / Streamlit	Web UI
Storage (Future)	SQLite / Firebase	Persistent user data
6. Development Progress
Phase	Status	Description
Phase 1	✅ Done	Built core logic (Response Engine, Feedback Manager, Preferences)
Phase 2	⚙️ In Progress	GUI + Analytics Hub (functional but needs polish)
Phase 3	🔜 Planned	Add OpenAI API for natural replies
Phase 4	🔜 Planned	Web-based version + login/auth system
7. Vision & Long-Term Goal

To transform this emotional AI assistant into a personal growth companion — one that not only replies intelligently but also helps users analyze their emotional and behavioral trends over time.

It could later evolve into:

AI Therapist / Mentor App

Daily Reflection Journal

Emotional Insight Dashboard

Or integrate into creative/learning apps as an AI Emotion Layer

8. Current Focus

🎯 Next Step:
Integrate OpenAI API responses while keeping your ResponseEngine as the emotional layer.
This means:

GPT handles the content of replies.

Your engine handles the emotion, tone, and personalization logic.
